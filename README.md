# MyPySQL
A more User Friendly and colored class written in Python 2.7 using MySQLdb :3

This class could help you using python Server-side to connect it with MySQL.<br>
I Try it in <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/"> pythonanywhere.com </a> and it worked.

I took the function FetchOneAssoc from <a target="_blank"  href="https://ianhowson.com/blog/a-quick-guide-to-using-mysql-in-python/"> ianhowson.com </a>, and the FormatAsTable from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.calazan.com/python-function-for-displaying-a-list-of-dictionaries-in-table-format/">calazan.com</a>. Thank You both :)
